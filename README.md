# gifloopcoder-scripts

A collection of random experiments made with Bit101's gifloopcoder

See https://github.com/bit101/gifloopcoder

To run these:

* Copy the scripts to gifloopcoder's "sketches/code" folder, and open the index.html file in glc's folder.
* Or clone this repository "next to" gifloopcoder (so they're side by side in the same parent folder), and open the index.html from this repository.

Enjoy!
